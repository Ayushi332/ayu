"""
WORKFLOW OF PROJECT:
1- Input from user(Rock, paper, scissor)
2- Computer choice (Computer will choose randomly not conditionally)
3- Result print

Cases:
A- Rock
Rock - Rock = tie
Rock - Paper = Paper win
Rock - scissor = Rock win

B - Paper
Paper - Paper = tie
Paper - Rock = Paper win
Paper - scissor = Scissor win

C - Scissor
Scissor - Scissor = tie
Scissor - Rock = Rock win
Scissor - Paper = Scissor win
